## Hi there! ğŸ‘‹

I am a pre-final year Computer Science undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur. I like exploring new domains and topics in Computer Science. I code mostly in C++ but I am also familiar with python, JavaScript and a bit of Java.

Here's a quote that i really like:

> **Aim for the moon. Even if you miss, you will end up in the stars.\
> ~ W. Clement Stone**
